<h1>
Stem Cell Education - Adult Stem Cells</h1>

For our final project in Stem Cell Engineering, we were tasked with creating a website that could be used as a learning tool for students in a subset of kindergarten to 12th grade.  We decided to target 7th to 9th graders and focus on an introduction to adult stem cells.  The website includes basic information, links to more in-depth discussions, teacher's resources, and assessments.
